If you'd like to know more about my past work, please check out my [CV](../cv), my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/kunaltyagi) and [Github](https://github.com/kunaltyagi) with username **kunaltyagi**.

I love making order from chaos, learning the cross-domain details of seemingly simple phenomenon and learning trivial things.
In my free time, I like to read fiction and sci-fi books. I prefer physical books over e-books but e-books are more convenient on the go.
For actual physical activity, I like soccer and have only recently started bouldering, snowboarding and swimming. Backstroke in particular is exhilarating.

You can find me working on some harebrained scheme of creating AI, or plodding away on some paper or code.
Apart from my core interests in AI, Robotics and trivia, I can also listen (and talk non-stop) for hours about inverse rendering (images and sound), evolution of languages (mostly C++, Rust and Haskell), structure of brain and many more topics.
